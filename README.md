# BeH2_dissociation_curve

Hi George! 

Could you please run BeH2.py with a single parameter running from 1.0 to 1.9 (10 points). It is important to use 1.0 instead of 1, as this will be compared against the name in the MolecularHamiltonian folder and 1 will yield an error, but 1.0 won't. Now if you run the script, the only critical dependencies are openfermion,scipy,numpy and pickle. 
If openfermion is a problem, I can get read of it by programming the used functionality myself, but hopefully it's not necessary. 

Thank you!

Vlad
